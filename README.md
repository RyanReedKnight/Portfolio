# Photo Portfolio Front End
Client for my photo portfolio web application, built with React and TypeScript.
Axios is used to make http requests to the backend of the application. Currently it is 
hosted on an AWS S3 bucket, which can be viewed <a href="http://photos-and-such.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/">here</a>, though in the future I hope to move it Nginx,
I have succesfully served the page via Nginx but had issues making requests to the backend.
