# Photo Portfolio Front End
Client for my photo portfolio web application, built with React and TypeScript.
Axios is used to make http requests to the backend of the application. The application served
by Nginx on an EC2 instance. On this EC2 instance Nginx is configured to make requests to another EC2 instance
where the back-end is hosted.
